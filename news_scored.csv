If you want to pay online, you need to register an account and provide credit card information. If you don't have a credit card, you can pay with bank transfer. With the rise of cryptocurrencies, these methods may become old.Imagine a world in which you can do transactions and many other things without having to give your personal information. A world in which you don’t need to rely on banks or governments anymore. Sounds amazing, right? That’s exactly what blockchain technology allows us to do.It’s like your computer’s hard drive. blockchain is a technology that lets you store data in digital blocks, which are connected together like links in a chain.&nbsp;Blockchain technology was originally invented in 1991 by two mathematicians, Stuart Haber and W. Scot Stornetta. They first proposed the system to ensure that timestamps could not be tampered with.A few years later, in 1998, software developer Nick Szabo proposed using a similar kind of technology to secure a digital payments system he called “Bit Gold.” However, this innovation was not adopted until Satoshi Nakamoto claimed to have invented the first Blockchain and Bitcoin.So, What is Blockchain?A blockchain is a distributed database shared between the nodes of a computer network. It saves information in digital format. Many people first heard of blockchain technology when they started to look up information about bitcoin.Blockchain is used in cryptocurrency systems to ensure secure, decentralized records of transactions.Blockchain allowed people to guarantee the fidelity and security of a record of data without the need for a third party to ensure accuracy.To understand how a blockchain works, Consider these basic steps:Blockchain collects information in “blocks”.A block has a storage capacity, and once it's used up, it can be closed and linked to a previously served block.Blocks form chains, which are called “Blockchains.”More information will be added to the block with the most content until its capacity is full. The process repeats itself.Each block in the chain has an exact timestamp and can't be changed.Let’s get to know more about the blockchain.How does blockchain work?Blockchain records digital information and distributes it across the network without changing it. The information is distributed among many users and stored in an immutable, permanent ledger that can't be changed or destroyed. That's why blockchain is also called ""Distributed Ledger Technology"" or DLT.Here’s how it works:Someone or a computer will transactsThe transaction is transmitted throughout the network.A network of computers can confirm the transaction.When it is confirmed a transaction is added to a blockThe blocks are linked together to create a history. And that’s the beauty of it! The process may seem complicated, but it’s done in minutes with modern technology. And because technology is advancing rapidly, I expect things to move even more quickly than ever.A new transaction is added to the system. It is then relayed to a network of computers located around the world. The computers then solve equations to ensure the authenticity of the transaction.Once a transaction is confirmed, it is placed in a block after the confirmation. All of the blocks are chained together to create a permanent history of every transaction.How are Blockchains used?Even though blockchain is integral to cryptocurrency, it has other applications. For example, blockchain can be used for storing reliable data about transactions. Many people confuse blockchain with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum.Blockchain already being adopted by some big-name companies, such as Walmart, AIG, Siemens, Pfizer, and Unilever. For example, IBM's Food Trust uses blockchain to track food's journey before reaching its final destination.Although some of you may consider this practice excessive, food suppliers and manufacturers adhere to the policy of tracing their products because bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella have been found in packaged foods. In addition, there have been isolated cases where dangerous allergens such as peanuts have accidentally been introduced into certain products.Tracing and identifying the sources of an outbreak is a challenging task that can take months or years. Thanks to the Blockchain, however, companies now know exactly where their food has been—so they can trace its location and prevent future outbreaks.Blockchain technology allows systems to react much faster in the event of a hazard. It also has many other uses in the modern world.What is Blockchain Decentralization?Blockchain technology is safe, even if it’s public. People can access the technology using an internet connection.Have you ever been in a situation where you had all your data stored at one place and that one secure place got compromised? Wouldn't it be great if there was a way to prevent your data from leaking out even when the security of your storage systems is compromised?Blockchain technology provides a wa",2025-11-14 21:17:33.100857+00:00,,,,,,0,government,techcrunch,0.9624890917912126,Highly Empathetic,joy,surprise,fear,
"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2525761963252134386.post-3876471029672017808","Most Frequently Asked Questions About Affiliate Marketing. There are lots of questions floating around about how affiliate marketing works, what to do and what not to do when it comes to setting up a business. With so much uncertainty surrounding both personal and business aspects of affiliate marketing. In this post, we will answer the most frequently asked question about affiliate marketing1. What is affiliate marketing?&nbsp;Affiliate marketing is a way to make money by promoting the products and services of other people and companies. You don't need to create your product or service, just promote existing ones. That's why it's so easy to get started with affiliate marketing. You can even get started with no budget at all!2. What is an affiliate program?&nbsp;An affiliate program is a package of information you create for your product, which is then made available to potential publishers. The program will typically include details about the product and its retail value, commission levels, and promotional materials. Many affiliate programs are managed via an affiliate network like ShareASale, which acts as a platform to connect publishers and advertisers, but it is also possible to offer your program directly.3. What is an affiliate network and how do affiliate networks make money?&nbsp;&nbsp;Affiliate networks connect publishers to advertisers.&nbsp; Affiliate networks make money by charging fees to the merchants who advertise with them; these merchants are known as advertisers. The percentage of each sale that the advertiser pays is negotiated between the merchant and the affiliate network.4. What's the difference between affiliate marketing and dropshipping?&nbsp;Dropshipping is a method of selling that allows you to run an online store without having to stock products. You advertise the products as if you owned them, but when someone makes an order, you create a duplicate order with the distributor at a reduced price. The distributor takes care of the post and packaging on your behalf. As affiliate marketing is based on referrals and this type of drop shipping requires no investment in inventory when a customer buys through the affiliate link, no money exchanges hands.&nbsp;5. Can affiliate marketing and performance marketing be considered the same thing? &nbsp;Performance marketing is a method of marketing that pays for performance, like when a sale is made or an ad is clicked This can include methods like PPC (pay-per-click) or display advertising. Affiliate marketing is one form of performance marketing where commissions are paid out to affiliates on a performance basis when they click on their affiliate link and make a purchase or action.&nbsp;6. Is it possible to promote affiliate offers on mobile devices?&nbsp;Smartphones are essentially miniature computers, so publishers can display the same websites and offers that are available on a PC. But mobiles also offer specific tools not available on computers, and these can be used to good effect for publishers. Publishers can optimize their ads for mobile users by making them easy to access by this audience. Publishers can also make good use of text and instant messaging to promote their offers. As the mobile market is predicted to make up 80% of traffic in the future, publishers who do not promote on mobile devices are missing out on a big opportunity.7. Where do I find qualified publishers?&nbsp;The best way to find affiliate publishers is on reputable networks like ShareASale Cj(Commission Junction), Awin, and Impact radius. These networks have a strict application process and compliance checks, which means that all affiliates are trustworthy.8. What is an affiliate disclosure statement?&nbsp;An affiliate disclosure statement discloses to the reader that there may be affiliate links on a website, for which a commission may be paid to the publisher if visitors follow these links and make purchases.&nbsp;9. Does social media activity play a significant role in affiliate marketing?&nbsp;Publishers promote their programs through a variety of means, including blogs, websites, email marketing, and pay-per-click ads. Social media has a huge interactive audience, making this platform a good source of potential traffic.10. What is a super affiliate?&nbsp;A super affiliate is an affiliate partner who consistently drives a large majority of sales from any program they promote, compared to other affiliate partners involved in that program.&nbsp; Affiliates make a lot of money from affiliate marketing Pat Flynn earned more than $50000 in 2013 from affiliate marketing.11. How do we track publisher sales activity?&nbsp;Publishers can be identified by their publisher ID, which is used in tracking cookies to determine which publishers generate sales. The activity is then viewed within a network's dashboard.&nbsp;12. Could we set up an affiliate program in multiple countries?&nbsp;Because the Internet is so widespread, affiliate programs can be promoted in any country. Affiliate strategies that are set internationally need",2025-11-14 21:17:33.098861+00:00,,,,,,0,branding & advertising,techcrunch,0.7948104664683342,Highly Empathetic,joy,anger,sadness,

"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2525761963252134386.post-5077419905984021446","Most Frequently Asked Questions About NFTs(Non-Fungible Tokens). &nbsp;Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are the most popular digital assets today, capturing the attention of cryptocurrency investors, whales and people from around the world. People find it amazing that some users spend thousands or millions of dollars on a single NFT-based image of a monkey or other token, but you can simply take a screenshot for free. So here we share some freuently asked question about NFTs.1) What is an NFT?NFT stands for non-fungible&nbsp; token, which is a cryptographic token on a blockchain with unique identification codes that distinguish it from other tokens. NFTs are unique and not interchangeable, which means no two NFTs are the same. NFTs can be a unique artwork, GIF, Images, videos, Audio album. in-game items, collectibles etc.2) What is Blockchain?A blockchain is a distributed digital ledger that allows for the secure storage of data. By recording any kind of information—such as bank account transactions, the ownership of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), or Decentralized Finance (DeFi) smart contracts—in one place, and distributing it to many different computers, blockchains ensure that data can’t be manipulated without everyone in the system being aware.3) What makes an NFT valuable? The value of an NFT comes from its ability to be traded freely and securely on the blockchain, which is not possible with other current digital ownership solutionsThe NFT points to its location on the blockchain, but doesn’t necessarily contain the digital property. For example, if you replace one bitcoin with another, you will still have the same thing. If you buy a non-fungible item, such as a movie ticket, it is impossible to replace it with any other movie ticket because each ticket is unique to a specific time and place.4) How do NFTs work?One of the unique characteristics of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is that they can be tokenised to create a digital certificate of ownership that can be bought, sold and traded on the blockchain.&nbsp;As with crypto-currency, records of who owns what are stored on a ledger that is maintained by thousands of computers around the world. These records can’t be forged because the whole system operates on an open-source network.&nbsp;NFTs also contain smart contracts—small computer programs that run on the blockchain—that give the artist, for example, a cut of any future sale of the token.5) What’s the connection between NFTs and cryptocurrency?Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) aren't cryptocurrencies, but they do use blockchain technology. Many NFTs are based on Ethereum, where the blockchain serves as a ledger for all the transactions related to said NFT and the properties it represents.5) How to make an NFT?Anyone can create an NFT. All you need is a digital wallet, some ethereum tokens and a connection to an NFT marketplace where you’ll be able to upload and sell your creations6) How to validate the authencity of an NFT?When you purchase a stock in NFT, that purchase is recorded on the blockchain—the bitcoin ledger of transactions—and that entry acts as your proof of ownership.7) How is an NFT valued? What are the most expensive NFTs?The value of an NFT varies a lot based on the digital asset up for grabs. People use NFTs to trade and sell digital art, so when creating an NFT, you should consider the popularity of your digital artwork along with historical statistics.In the year 2021, a digital artist called Pak created an artwork called The Merge. It was sold on the Nifty Gateway NFT market for $91.8 million.8) Can NFTs be used as an investment?Non-fungible tokens can be used in investment opportunities. One can purchase an NFT and resell it at a profit. Certain NFT marketplaces let sellers of NFTs keep a percentage of the profits from sales of the assets they create.9) Will NFTs be the future of art and collectibles?Many people want to buy NFTs because it lets them support the arts and own something cool from their favorite musicians, brands, and celebrities. NFTs also give artists an opportunity to program in continual royalties if someone buys their work. Galleries see this as a way to reach new buyers interested in art.10) How do we buy an NFTs?There are many places to buy digital assets, like opensea and their policies vary. On top shot, for instance, you sign up for a waitlist that can be thousands of people long. When a digital asset goes on sale, you are occasionally chosen to purchase it.11) Can i mint NFT for free?To mint an NFT token, you must pay some amount of gas fee to process the transaction on the Etherum blockchain, but you can mint your NFT on a different blockchain called Polygon to avoid paying gas fees. This option is available on OpenSea and this simply denotes that your NFT will only be able to trade using Polygon's blockchain and not Etherum's blockchain. Mintable allows you to mint NFTs for free without paying any gas fees.12) Do i own an NFT if i screenshot it? The answer is no. Non-Fungible Tokens are minted on the blockchain using cryptocurrencie",2025-11-14 21:17:33.111686+00:00,,,,,,0,economics,techcrunch,0.9964450382394716,Highly Empathetic,joy,sadness,love,

Briefing wars, toxic infighting, paranoid office politics: we’ve seen it all before. And once again, the drama at No 10 has absolutely nothing to do with us Sorry, what just happened? Before we hurtle on to the next instalment of Labour government drama, let’s pause for a second to recap. So Keir Starmer’s allies briefed against Wes Streeting accusing him of plotting a leadership challenge, then Streeting denied the claims, and Starmer apologised for them, before belatedly claiming the briefing had not come from Downing Street at all. A claim so implausible that a government source said journalists “must have all been tricked by several impostors posing as No 10 staff”.If this sounds farcical, vaguely embarrassing for all concerned and massively irrelevant to your life, you would be right. But in between the first chapter and the last (or perhaps the penultimate, given the aftershocks still reverberating through No 10), the episode acted as a masterclass in the patterns that define the stakes of British politics and characterise the stakeholders.

If the promise of a better private rental sector is to be realised, councils will need new staff as well as stricter rulesTenants need rights. Apart from food and water, shelter is the most basic human need and relevant to almost everyone all the time – unlike, say, healthcare, which most people do not use on a daily basis. A rebalancing of the law towards renters and away from landlords, which the government has done in its Renters’ Rights Act, was sorely needed. Failures and abuses of power have been ignored for too long.With no-fault evictions outlawed from next May, and tougher oversight from a new ombudsman to follow, life should be about to get better for England’s 4.6m households in the private rental sector. But will it? Troubling analysis by the Guardian shows that two-thirds of councils in England have not prosecuted a single landlord in the past three years, while nearly half didn’t issue any fines either. Over the same period, fewer than 2% of complaints led to enforcement of any kind. Just 16 landlords were banned from letting homes – a shockingly low number, given the volume of complaints and what has been revealed about the sector by the worst scandals.

"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2525761963252134386.post-4705741174433838580","Most Frequently Asked Questions About Email Marketing. 1. Why is email marketing important?Email is the marketing tool that helps you&nbsp; create a seamless, connected, frictionless buyer journey. More importantly, email marketing allows you to build relationships with prospects, customers, and past customers. It's your chance to speak&nbsp; to them right in their inbox, at a time that suits them. Along with the right message, email can become one of your most powerful marketing channels.2. What is benefits of email marketing?Email marketing is best way for creating long term relationship with your clients, and increasing sales in our company.Benefits of email marketing for bussiness:Better brand recognitionStatistics of what works bestMore salesTargeted audienceMore traffic to your products/services/newsletterBuild credibilityMost&nbsp; bussinesses are using email marketing and making tons of money with email marketing.3. What is the simplest day and time to send my marketing emails?Again, the answer to this question varies from company to company. And again, testing is the way to find out what works best. Typically, weekends and mornings seem to be&nbsp; times when multiple emails are opened, but since your audience may have different habits, it's best to experiment and then use your&nbsp; data to decide.&nbsp;4. Which metrics should I be looking at?The two most important metrics for email marketing are&nbsp; open rate and click-through rate. If your emails aren't opened, subscribers will never see your full marketing message, and if they open them but don't click through to your site, your emails won't convert.5. How do I write a decent subject line?The best subject lines are short and to the point, accurately describing&nbsp; the content of the email, but also catchy and intriguing, so the reader wants to know more. Once Again, this is the perfect place for&nbsp; A/B testing, to see what types of subject lines work best with your audience. Your call to action should be clear and&nbsp; simple. It should be somewhere at the top of your email for those who haven't finished reading the entire email,&nbsp; then repeated&nbsp; at the end for those reading all the way through. It should state exactly what you want subscribers to do, for example ""Click here to download the premium theme for free. 6. Is email marketing still effective?Email marketing is one of the most effective ways for a business to reach its customers directly. Think about it. You don't post something on your site&nbsp; hoping people will visit it. You don't even post something on a social media page and hope fans&nbsp; see it. You're sending something straight to each person's inbox, where they'll definitely&nbsp; see it! Even if they don't open it, they'll still see your subject line and business name every time you send an email, so you're still communicating directly with your audience. 7. However do I grow my email subscribers list? Should i buy an email list or build it myself?Buying an email list is&nbsp; waste of time &amp; money. These email accounts are unverified and not interested in your brand. The mailing list is useless if your subscribers do not open your emails. There are different ways to grow your mailing list.&nbsp;Give them a free ebook and host it on a landing page where they have to enter the email to download the file and also create a forum page on your website, asks your visitors what questions they might have about your business, and collects email addresses to follow up with them. 8. How do I prevent audience from unsubscribing?If the&nbsp; subject line of the email is irrelevant to&nbsp; customers, they will ignore it multiple times. But, if it keeps repeating, they are intercepted and unsubscribed from your emails. So, send relevant emails for the benefit of the customer. Don't send emails that often only focus&nbsp; on sales, offers and discounts.&nbsp;Submit information about your business and offers so you can connect with customers. You can also update them on recent trends in your industry. The basic role of an email is first and foremost to&nbsp; connect with customers, get the most out of this tool.9. What is the difference between a cold email and a spam email?Cold emails are mostly sales emails that are sent with content align to the needs of the recipient. It is usually personalized and includes a business perspective. However, it is still an unsolicited email. And all unsolicited emails are marked as SPAM.&nbsp;Regularly receiving this type of unsolicited email in your users' inboxes, chances are&nbsp; your emails will soon be diverted to&nbsp; spam or junk folders. The most important thing to prevent this from happening is to respect your recipients' choice to opt-out of receiving emails from you. You can add the links to easily unsubscribe. You must be familiar with the CAN-SPAM Act and its regulations.10. Where can I find email template?Almost all email campaign tools provide you with ready-made templates.

t3_1ovl85w,"Former Microsoft CEO’s philanthropy will donate up to $170M a year for free preschool in WA. The Ballmer Group’s gift could add up to 10,000 early childhood education slots over the next decade. It comes on the condition that the state not make further cuts to the program. Just a snippet from the article: The Ballmer Group on Wednesday committed hundreds of millions of dollars for free preschool in Washington, a massive philanthropic contribution amid state budget cuts and federal rollbacks. The donation of up to $170 million per year for the next decade could fund 10,000 additional slots in the state’s Early Childhood Education and Assistance Program, or ECEAP, for low-income families. The program currently has just over 14,000 slots statewide at over 460 locations. The Ballmer Group was founded by former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and his wife Connie. Gov. Bob Ferguson called the funding “truly transformative.” “It’d be hard to quantify how significant that investment will be for our state,” Ferguson said at a press conference Wednesday, announcing the news at the Denise Louie Education Center in Seattle. As a condition of getting the gift, the state pledged no further budget cuts to the ECEAP program for the next 10 years. &#32; submitted by &#32; /u/Silent-Resort-3076 [link] &#32; [comments]",2025-11-14 21:17:35.128183+00:00,,,,,,0,education,reddit_uplifting_news,0.9939937642775476,Highly Empathetic,joy,love,sadness,

And yet, if recent briefings suggesting that Labour will dramatically scale back the heat pump subsidy for households are to be believed, it is now repeating exactly the same mistakes as its predecessors.People want relief from painful energy bills. In the long term, electrification is the only way to provide this. In practice, that means switching from gas boilers to heat pumps, shifting from petrol cars to electric vehicles: boosting access to technologies that are modern, cheaper to run, and are already becoming mainstream. At present, our energy system protects the legacy gas-based system, subsidising supply and penalising demand in ways that keep gas artificially cheap and electricity artificially expensive, even when electric technologies cost less to operate.Camilla Born is the CEO of Electrify Britain, a campaigning organisation founded by EDF and Octopus Energy Continue reading...",2025-11-14 21:17:27.074685+00:00,,,,,,0,government,guardian_politics,0.8302856786176562,Highly Empathetic,joy,sadness,anger,

One set of advisers believed that given the scale of the fiscal challenge facing the chancellor, she should do what no chancellor has done in 50 years and put up income taxes. The other worried that breaking a key manifesto pledge would be political suicide and that Reeves should find multiple other ways to raise taxes – what some called a “smorgasbord”.For weeks, Reeves had appeared to side with the first camp, delivering speeches warning of difficult choices to come and telling a BBC interviewer that keeping her manifesto promises would mean cutting spending.

This is a significant policy event, with local and national implications. However, the prime minister did not spend much time in Wales promoting solutions to UK energy needs. Instead, he spent it trying to draw a line under the Labour leadership briefing row, telling reporters that No 10 had not, in fact, briefed against the health secretary’s ambitions earlier this week.As such, Sir Keir’s day was a microcosm of what his prime ministership has now become more generally. On the one hand, he wants his government to be doing,&nbsp;and to be seen to be doing, important things. On the other hand, he is unable to achieve this because of the way he – and to an extent the country more generally – now does politics and government.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

If it isn’t you, then it’s probably your neighbour, your friend, your elderly parent; trapped in an anxious, miserable limbo for months longer than they should have been, getting passed from pillar to post. The only thing we don’t all know about waiting lists, it turns out, is that actually they’re coming down.Barely a quarter of the public in England knew waiting lists had fallen in Labour’s first year in power, according to recent polling for the Health Foundation thinktank in September: more than a third thought they had just kept going up, presumably because that’s what we have become gloomily resigned to. Since waiting lists are one of those emotional yardsticks by which people judge whether the country is falling apart or not, you would think the government might like to mention this, and indeed this week it planned to. But then someone close to Keir Starmer chose to accuse the health secretary of plotting a coup two days before a planned speech on NHS reform, accidentally ensuring that Wes Streeting’s pre-booked stint on breakfast telly was mostly spent debating whether the prime minister is toast or not.

This is like me apologising for accidentally releasing sex offenders from prison. I suppose there is the occasional previous example in public life.

Heaven is ‘a socialist state’. David Attenborough is ‘anti-human’ – the startling theories of Reform MP Danny Kruger. He was a Conservative party big-hitter who wrote speeches for David Cameron and worked with Boris Johnson before he suddenly jumped ship. He talks family, flags and why Nigel Farage is ‘top dog’What I struggle to understand, I say to Danny Kruger in his office at Reform UK HQ, is why a serious Conservative, with a glittering future like yours, would defect to a party led by Nigel Farage? Indeed, the defection of Kruger, a heavy-weight on the Conservative right who served on the front bench and been tipped as a possible future leader, was seen as a major coup for Reform, catching commentators off-guard. Unlike previous deserters – Andrea Jenkyns, Jake Berry, Nadine Dorries – he was a sitting MP in a safe Tory seat. Plus, he was untarnished by the boisterous excesses of Boris Johnson and Liz Truss.But we’ve been around the houses a few times on&nbsp;this. He’s talked about his philosophy (Burkean), his Christianity (evangelical), thrown out words like “family”, “community”, “nation”. He’s asserted (confusingly) that the Tories are “over” but “not dead”, that politics is mostly “gut feeling … mostly vibes – isn’t&nbsp;it?” Now, after a pause, Kruger sits back and fixes me with a blue-eyed grin: “Humans are pack animals,” he says. “You need to know who top dog is, otherwise&nbsp;the other dogs fight each other. That’s what we get in Tory and Labour. Because there’s a weakness at the&nbsp;top.” Continue reading...",,,,,,,0,culture & identity,guardian_politics,0.8104632291942835,Highly Empathetic,joy,anger,love,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/nov/22/america-is-british-heaven-is-a-socialist-state-david-attenborough-is-anti-human-theories-of-reform-mp-danny-kruger

The problem is, it doesn’t even work in Denmark | Cas Mudde. This week’s local elections are the latest reminder that when social democrats move rightwards, they’re making a mistakeCas Mudde is the author of The Far Right TodayAfter more than 100 years, Copenhagen no longer has a Social Democrat mayor. Sisse Marie Welling, the new lord mayor, represents neither the mainstream right nor the far right but the Green Left (Socialistisk Folkeparti, known as SF). This should be a major wake-up call for centre-left parties across Europe. After more than a decade taking the wrong lessons from Denmark, it is finally time to learn the right lesson: copying the far right not only fails to turn on far-right voters, it also turns off progressive voters.The 21st century has so far seen two simultaneous electoral developments in western Europe: the decline of social-democratic parties and the rise of far-right parties. This has created the powerful narrative that social democrats are losing votes to the far right, in particular because of their (alleged) “pro-immigration” positions. And although research shows that their voters mainly moved to centre-right and green parties, social-democratic parties have been chasing this mythical “left behind” voter ever since.Cas Mudde is the Stanley Wade Shelton UGAF professor of international affairs at the University of Georgia, and author of The Far Right TodayDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

A lesson was all it was, until it wasn’t. “It was a standard day,” said Michael Reese, Anthony’s stepfather. “I was going to go to bed and it was probably about 9 at night and, next thing you know, I woke up [and] I was in the emergency room at Buffalo General Hospital.” Anthony and his mom, Jennifer, woke up to the sounds of their dogs barking. “I looked at the bottom of the stairs and his head was laying right there on the ground, and his feet were up on the third stair,&quot; Jennifer recalled. &quot;He was making a gurgling sound, very clammy, eyes rolled back, completely non-responsive.” With 911 on the line, it was up to them to start compressions. “In that moment, I didn't know what to do. And he's like, 'Mom, it's OK, I got this,'” recalled Jennifer. For the next eight minutes, Anthony did CPR on his stepfather, Michael. “I wasn't really tired. I was just worried,&quot; recalled Anthony. &quot;But I had to get with my senses saying, 'He's going to die if I don't do this.' So I just kept doing it, no matter what.” Michael was fading in and out. “Eight minutes is a very long time when you're in that moment. It felt like 800 minutes,” said Jennifer. “I can only imagine, that’s a workout,&quot; added Michael. &quot;I give him a lot of credit.” Eventually, help got there. Michael’s heart was shocked two times and he was taken to the hospital and on the road to recovery. &#32; submitted by &#32; /u/Silent-Resort-3076 [link] &#32; [comments]",,,,,,,0,technology & ai,reddit_uplifting_news,0.0046000852016732,Cold / Hostile,surprise,fear,joy,https://www.reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/comments/1p391wm/western_ny_teen_saves_stepfather_with_cpr_learned/

t3_1p0doga,"How 20-year-old Kenyan student turned a local fundraiser into nonprofit serving 600,000 meals a day. Snippet: In Kenya, more than 600,000 children line up for lunch each school day through Food4Education, the organization founded by Wawira Njiru. Each child wears a bright wristband that they tap to receive a hot meal. Since its founding, the nonprofit has served over 100 million meals to students in Kenya, but it began with a simple meal Njiru cooked herself for 80 people. When she was a 20-year-old international student studying in Australia, Njiru realized how small sums of money readily available in that country could make a significant difference back home in Kenya. She came up with the idea for a local fundraiser, cooking for 80 people. It failed as a meal. “I cooked all the food ... and it was not good food. No, it was burnt rice. ... cooking for 80 people is a lot,” she recalled in an interview with Julia Boorstin for the latest episode of the “CNBC Changemakers and Power Players” podcast. But the concept worked. “People gave me $20 each. Raised $1,250 and started feeding 25 kids in my community. And that was the start of Food4Education,” Njiru said. Today, what looks like a simple cashless payment represents much more. “When you give someone food, the first thing, and the first motivation that I have, is to give them dignity,” she said. Njiru calls her approach “operationalizing dignity.” From the kitchens to the payment systems, every element of Food4Education is built to ensure that no one feels like a charity case. “Our kids, our parents, we treat them like our customers,” she said. “They’re not beneficiaries, because they do contribute a subsidized amount, and they do have ownership.” The majority of the staff who work with the organization are also parents of the children being served, “so when they’re cooking the meals, when they’re distributing the meals, they’re serving their own communities, and there’s so much pride that comes from that,” Njiru said. &#32; submitted by &#32; /u/Silent-Resort-3076 [link] &#32; [comments]",,,,,,,0,technology & ai,reddit_uplifting_news,0.9932664353400468,Highly Empathetic,joy,love,sadness,

There is mounting disquiet among Labour MPs, while the vulnerable refugees at the heart of this story are living with a renewed sense of panicIf the home secretary’s twin aims in making her controversial series of immigration reform announcements this week were to receive a ringing endorsement from the far right and to make migrants quake in their boots, she has succeeded – possibly even exceeded – her own expectations.The endorsement came on Saturday, courtesy of Tommy Robinson, real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon. In response to a post on X which predicted that Shabana Mahmood would announce that refugees will be granted only a temporary stay in the UK and deported if their home countries are later deemed safe, he posted: “The Overton window has been obliterated, well done patriots.” Meanwhile, asylum seekers and refugees I have spoken to are panicked, trembling and crying at the prospect of having to be uprooted once again after feeling safe in the UK, often after experiencing years of risk and danger.Diane Taylor writes on human rights, racism and civil libertiesDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

After 14 years of Tory rule, the Guardian’s parliamentary sketch writer thought he had seen it all. Westminster would surely tick along nicely once Keir Starmer’s party took over. How wrong he was ...I feel I should probably start with an apology. A few days after the 2024 general election, I wrote that it felt as if the grownups were back in charge. It wasn’t as if I was carried away by the vision of Keir Starmer or the charisma of Rachel Reeves. More that I felt we had regained a basic level of competence. That politics would become business as usual rather than the breathless psychodrama of the past 10 years.

A fixation on reducing numbers leaves no room for rational discussion of what that means for the economy and societyBritish political debate has long been dominated by public anxiety about rising levels of immigration. How might that change if the population tide were to turn? Not at all, would appear to be the answer. Net migration has in fact been falling since before Labour came to power last July, and yet there has been no end of demand for ever tighter controls and no end of government acquiescence.New figures published this week by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), adjusting historical data for methodological changes, show that net migration was 944,000 for the year ending March 2023 – about 40,000 higher than had previously been thought. The drop since then has also been steeper. The number for the year ending December 2024 is now thought to be 345,000 – lower than the earlier count by 86,000.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Voters need to know if a party leader said racist things at school. Interviewers have a duty to keep pressing for fuller factsFor one contemporary, it is the hectoring tone of today that evokes what it was like to be at school with Nigel&nbsp;Farage. “He would sidle up to me and growl: ‘Hitler was right’ or ‘Gas them’,” Peter Ettedgui recalls when asked about life at fee-paying Dulwich College in&nbsp;the late 1970s and early 1980s. Later, he adds: “I’d&nbsp;hear him calling other students ‘Paki’ or ‘Wog’ and&nbsp;urging them to ‘go home’.”For others, including some in the college’s combined cadet force (CCF), what lingers is the image of the young Mr Farage in uniform and his renderings of a racist anthem titled “Gas ’em all”. Tim France, a CCF member from those years, remembered Mr Farage “regularly” giving the Nazi salute and strutting around&nbsp;the classroom. “It was habitual, you know, it&nbsp;happened all the time,” he recalls.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

A life in politics is not for the squeamish.Wes Streeting, a practising Christian, yesterday writhed while answering questions on LBC radio about the home secretary’s tough plans for deterring small boat arrivals. The flavour of his reply reflected how many on Labour’s benches feel. Confronted with the government’s intention to deport more families with children – ending what Shabana Mahmood said was feeble “hesitancy” – he sought a bogus escape by claiming many would leave voluntarily, making forced removals “low”. But when pushed, he said yes, removals must be enforced. Was he comfortable with that? “Honestly? Comfortable? No. But is it the right thing to do for the country?

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/21/the-guardian-view-on-the-covid-19-inquiry-the-uk-did-too-little-too-late-lessons-must-be-learned,"The Guardian view on the Covid-19 inquiry: the UK did too little, too late. Lessons must be learned | Editorial. The latest report on the pandemic shows that grave failings were not limited to Boris Johnson. The government needs to prepare for the next crisisAll four of the UK’s governments are criticised in the latest report from the public inquiry into the coronavirus pandemic of 2020-22. The Northern Ireland Executive’s response is judged to have been marred by political divisions. In Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon did not involve cabinet colleagues enough in decision-making (though she is also described as serious and diligent). In Wales, Mark Drakeford’s government mirrored some of the errors made in London, particularly when it delayed the introduction of new restrictions in the autumn of 2020.But rightly, given its responsibilities, size and resources, as well as its record, the UK administration led by Boris Johnson comes in for the biggest share of blame. Some of Heather Hallett’s findings regarding the political governance of the crisis are already familiar. Nothing in this report will damage the former prime minister’s reputation as much as what is already known about lockdown-breaking social gatherings in 2020 – or the fact that he misled parliament about them.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/20/unelected-lords-blocking-assisted-dying-democratic-outrage,"Unelected Lords are blocking assisted dying – this is a democratic outrage | Simon Jenkins. Second chambers are a good idea, but they should not be able to overturn clear decisions reached by an elected bodyIf ever a British institution needed assistance in dying, it is the House of Lords. Its handling of the assisted dying bill on Friday of last week, continuing this week, is all but unconstitutional. A bill passed by the House of Commons after years of public debate is being blocked by a small group of peers under the pretence of scrutiny. Their purpose is to kill the bill by filibuster and impose their religious or moral views on the free will of others. They want to deny Britons a freedom now common in many liberal nations across the western world.When the bill came to the Lords, just seven peers were responsible for 617 of 1,034 amendments now attached to it. They included a requirement that no one should be helped to die if they have been abroad in the previous year, or unless five doctors have assessed the application, or if a doctor has discussed dying with the patient (a so-called gag clause). Many amendments flatly contradict ones considered and rejected by the Commons. They pay no deference to the support for the bill of what is now a clear majority of public opinion. The intention is not to scrutinise the bill, but to kill it by exceeding the four days allotted to it. Since it is a private member’s bill, the government has declined to help. It should now adopt it and force it through.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...",,,,,,,0,technology & ai,guardian_politics,0.0083384588360786,Cold / Hostile,anger,sadness,joy,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/20/unelected-lords-blocking-assisted-dying-democratic-outrage

Who knows where this government’s credibility will be after next week’s exceptionally difficult budgetBy instinct and conviction, Rachel Reeves is a traditionally social democratic, centre-left Labour chancellor. When she delivers her budget next week, though, those qualities will be hard to discern. The reason for that is simple but powerful. She has become hemmed in on every side by avoidably tight commitments on taxation, spending and borrowing. Above all, however, she is hemmed in by Labour politics.It did not have to be this way. Reeves would have had a freer fiscal hand if she and Labour had not ruled out increasing all the three main personal taxes at the 2024 election – a choice the former Conservative minister David Willetts described this week as “catastrophic”. Reeves might also have won herself more elbow room, albeit at some political cost, if the new government had moved very decisively to say that, having studied the figures, the triple-tax pledge was in fact unsustainable.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...",,,,,,,0,technology & ai,guardian_politics,0.8386895838193595,Highly Empathetic,joy,sadness,anger,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/20/labour-government-credibility-budget

It is uncomfortable to watch royals appealing to the nation’s best instincts while an elected government feels compelled to chase our worstEvery child has the right to feel safe, loved and as if they belong.Put like that, there is nothing remotely radical about what the Princess of Wales used her first public speech since recovering from cancer to say: that families need consistently nurturing environments to flourish; that the world could actually use a bit more tenderness; that we are all responsible for the culture in which future generations grow up; and that (as she told an audience of blue-chip employers) caring for others is work deserving of respect. It’s the reasons why those motherhood-and-apple-pie values don’t always prevail in real life, rather than the values themselves, that are generally too contentious for the carefully apolitical royals. Yet what were once safe, bland nothings are increasingly no longer so – and not just because of the awkward shadow now cast over any royal initiative involving childhood by the former prince Andrew’s infamous association with the sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?
