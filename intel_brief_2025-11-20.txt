KEY THREATS:
1. **Nuclear and WMD Threats**: High-intensity concerns persist regarding nuclear and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats, underscoring the need for vigilance and strategic countermeasures.
2. **Middle East Tensions**: The ongoing Israeli strikes in Gaza, resulting in casualties and ceasefire violations, continue to destabilize the region, with potential spillover effects on global security.
