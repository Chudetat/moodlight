### What It Does

**Watches everything.** 236 RSS feeds, X/Twitter, NewsAPI, and 7 global market indices — ingested, scored, and analyzed continuously.

**Detects what matters.** 21 autonomous detectors identify anomalies across mood shifts, breaking signals, brand crises, competitive threats, regulatory surges, geopolitical escalation, and more — including predictive signals that fire *before* thresholds are crossed.

**Investigates automatically.** Every significant detection triggers a multi-step AI reasoning chain: What's happening? Has it happened before? Why? What should you do? How confident are we? Up to 5 steps of analysis with confidence scoring and early bailout.

**Connects the dots.** When multiple signals fire together, the correlation engine detects relationships and generates unified Situation Reports — "geopolitical escalation is driving market divergence and shifting sentiment for defense brands."

**Delivers intelligence to you.** Real-time alert emails. Twice-daily intelligence briefs. Weekly strategic digests. You receive decision-ready intelligence without logging in.

### What Makes Moodlight Different

Most AI tools wrap a language model in a prompt loop and call it an "agent." Moodlight's intelligence is **domain-native** — a custom detection layer with 21 statistical detectors, predictive trend analysis, and proprietary VLDS scoring decides *what matters*. AI is called surgically for investigation, competitor discovery, and strategic framework application. **The LLM is a tool, not the brain.**

The result: you get intelligence that's precise, adaptive, and grounded in data — not hallucinated summaries of the internet.
