Why is email marketing important?Email is the marketing tool that helps you&nbsp; create a seamless, connected, frictionless buyer journey. More importantly, email marketing allows you to build relationships with prospects, customers, and past customers. It's your chance to speak&nbsp; to them right in their inbox, at a time that suits them. Along with the right message, email can become one of your most powerful marketing channels.2.

What is the simplest day and time to send my marketing emails?Again, the answer to this question varies from company to company. And again, testing is the way to find out what works best. Typically, weekends and mornings seem to be&nbsp; times when multiple emails are opened, but since your audience may have different habits, it's best to experiment and then use your&nbsp; data to decide.&nbsp;4. Which metrics should I be looking at?The two most important metrics for email marketing are&nbsp; open rate and click-through rate. If your emails aren't opened, subscribers will never see your full marketing message, and if they open them but don't click through to your site, your emails won't convert.5. How do I write a decent subject line?The best subject lines are short and to the point, accurately describing&nbsp; the content of the email, but also catchy and intriguing, so the reader wants to know more. Once Again, this is the perfect place for&nbsp; A/B testing, to see what types of subject lines work best with your audience. Your call to action should be clear and&nbsp; simple. It should be somewhere at the top of your email for those who haven't finished reading the entire email,&nbsp; then repeated&nbsp; at the end for those reading all the way through. It should state exactly what you want subscribers to do, for example ""Click here to download the premium theme for free. 6. Is email marketing still effective?Email marketing is one of the most effective ways for a business to reach its customers directly. Think about it. You don't post something on your site&nbsp; hoping people will visit it. You don't even post something on a social media page and hope fans&nbsp; see it. You're sending something straight to each person's inbox, where they'll definitely&nbsp; see it! Even if they don't open it, they'll still see your subject line and business name every time you send an email, so you're still communicating directly with your audience. 7. However do I grow my email subscribers list? Should i buy an email list or build it myself?Buying an email list is&nbsp; waste of time &amp; money. These email accounts are unverified and not interested in your brand. The mailing list is useless if your subscribers do not open your emails. There are different ways to grow your mailing list.&nbsp;Give them a free ebook and host it on a landing page where they have to enter the email to download the file and also create a forum page on your website, asks your visitors what questions they might have about your business, and collects email addresses to follow up with them. 8. How do I prevent audience from unsubscribing?If the&nbsp; subject line of the email is irrelevant to&nbsp; customers, they will ignore it multiple times. But, if it keeps repeating, they are intercepted and unsubscribed from your emails. So, send relevant emails for the benefit of the customer. Don't send emails that often only focus&nbsp; on sales, offers and discounts.&nbsp;Submit information about your business and offers so you can connect with customers. You can also update them on recent trends in your industry. The basic role of an email is first and foremost to&nbsp; connect with customers, get the most out of this tool.9. What is the difference between a cold email and a spam email?Cold emails are mostly sales emails that are sent with content align to the needs of the recipient. It is usually personalized and includes a business perspective. However, it is still an unsolicited email. And all unsolicited emails are marked as SPAM.&nbsp;Regularly receiving this type of unsolicited email in your users' inboxes, chances are&nbsp; your emails will soon be diverted to&nbsp; spam or junk folders.

"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2525761963252134386.post-5077419905984021446","Most Frequently Asked Questions About NFTs(Non-Fungible Tokens). &nbsp;Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are the most popular digital assets today, capturing the attention of cryptocurrency investors, whales and people from around the world. People find it amazing that some users spend thousands or millions of dollars on a single NFT-based image of a monkey or other token, but you can simply take a screenshot for free. So here we share some freuently asked question about NFTs.1) What is an NFT?NFT stands for non-fungible&nbsp; token, which is a cryptographic token on a blockchain with unique identification codes that distinguish it from other tokens. NFTs are unique and not interchangeable, which means no two NFTs are the same. NFTs can be a unique artwork, GIF, Images, videos, Audio album. in-game items, collectibles etc.2) What is Blockchain?A blockchain is a distributed digital ledger that allows for the secure storage of data. By recording any kind of information—such as bank account transactions, the ownership of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), or Decentralized Finance (DeFi) smart contracts—in one place, and distributing it to many different computers, blockchains ensure that data can’t be manipulated without everyone in the system being aware.3) What makes an NFT valuable? The value of an NFT comes from its ability to be traded freely and securely on the blockchain, which is not possible with other current digital ownership solutionsThe NFT points to its location on the blockchain, but doesn’t necessarily contain the digital property. For example, if you replace one bitcoin with another, you will still have the same thing. If you buy a non-fungible item, such as a movie ticket, it is impossible to replace it with any other movie ticket because each ticket is unique to a specific time and place.4) How do NFTs work?One of the unique characteristics of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is that they can be tokenised to create a digital certificate of ownership that can be bought, sold and traded on the blockchain.&nbsp;As with crypto-currency, records of who owns what are stored on a ledger that is maintained by thousands of computers around the world. These records can’t be forged because the whole system operates on an open-source network.&nbsp;NFTs also contain smart contracts—small computer programs that run on the blockchain—that give the artist, for example, a cut of any future sale of the token.5) What’s the connection between NFTs and cryptocurrency?Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) aren't cryptocurrencies, but they do use blockchain technology. Many NFTs are based on Ethereum, where the blockchain serves as a ledger for all the transactions related to said NFT and the properties it represents.5) How to make an NFT?Anyone can create an NFT. All you need is a digital wallet, some ethereum tokens and a connection to an NFT marketplace where you’ll be able to upload and sell your creations6) How to validate the authencity of an NFT?When you purchase a stock in NFT, that purchase is recorded on the blockchain—the bitcoin ledger of transactions—and that entry acts as your proof of ownership.7) How is an NFT valued? What are the most expensive NFTs?The value of an NFT varies a lot based on the digital asset up for grabs. People use NFTs to trade and sell digital art, so when creating an NFT, you should consider the popularity of your digital artwork along with historical statistics.In the year 2021, a digital artist called Pak created an artwork called The Merge. It was sold on the Nifty Gateway NFT market for $91.8 million.8) Can NFTs be used as an investment?Non-fungible tokens can be used in investment opportunities. One can purchase an NFT and resell it at a profit. Certain NFT marketplaces let sellers of NFTs keep a percentage of the profits from sales of the assets they create.9) Will NFTs be the future of art and collectibles?Many people want to buy NFTs because it lets them support the arts and own something cool from their favorite musicians, brands, and celebrities. NFTs also give artists an opportunity to program in continual royalties if someone buys their work. Galleries see this as a way to reach new buyers interested in art.10) How do we buy an NFTs?There are many places to buy digital assets, like opensea and their policies vary. On top shot, for instance, you sign up for a waitlist that can be thousands of people long. When a digital asset goes on sale, you are occasionally chosen to purchase it.11) Can i mint NFT for free?To mint an NFT token, you must pay some amount of gas fee to process the transaction on the Etherum blockchain, but you can mint your NFT on a different blockchain called Polygon to avoid paying gas fees. This option is available on OpenSea and this simply denotes that your NFT will only be able to trade using Polygon's blockchain and not Etherum's blockchain. Mintable allows you to mint NFTs for free without paying any gas fees.12) Do i own an NFT if i screenshot it? The answer is no. Non-Fungible Tokens are minted on the blockchain using cryptocurrencie",2025-11-28 14:15:19.964136+00:00,https://techncruncher.blogspot.com/2022/02/most-frequently-asked-questions-about.html,techcrunch,war & foreign policy,0

"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2525761963252134386.post-2614342552940509599","What is Blockchain: Everything You Need to Know (2022). If you want to pay online, you need to register an account and provide credit card information. If you don't have a credit card, you can pay with bank transfer. With the rise of cryptocurrencies, these methods may become old.Imagine a world in which you can do transactions and many other things without having to give your personal information. A world in which you don’t need to rely on banks or governments anymore. Sounds amazing, right? That’s exactly what blockchain technology allows us to do.It’s like your computer’s hard drive. blockchain is a technology that lets you store data in digital blocks, which are connected together like links in a chain.&nbsp;Blockchain technology was originally invented in 1991 by two mathematicians, Stuart Haber and W. Scot Stornetta. They first proposed the system to ensure that timestamps could not be tampered with.A few years later, in 1998, software developer Nick Szabo proposed using a similar kind of technology to secure a digital payments system he called “Bit Gold.” However, this innovation was not adopted until Satoshi Nakamoto claimed to have invented the first Blockchain and Bitcoin.So, What is Blockchain?A blockchain is a distributed database shared between the nodes of a computer network. It saves information in digital format. Many people first heard of blockchain technology when they started to look up information about bitcoin.Blockchain is used in cryptocurrency systems to ensure secure, decentralized records of transactions.Blockchain allowed people to guarantee the fidelity and security of a record of data without the need for a third party to ensure accuracy.To understand how a blockchain works, Consider these basic steps:Blockchain collects information in “blocks”.A block has a storage capacity, and once it's used up, it can be closed and linked to a previously served block.Blocks form chains, which are called “Blockchains.”More information will be added to the block with the most content until its capacity is full. The process repeats itself.Each block in the chain has an exact timestamp and can't be changed.Let’s get to know more about the blockchain.How does blockchain work?Blockchain records digital information and distributes it across the network without changing it. The information is distributed among many users and stored in an immutable, permanent ledger that can't be changed or destroyed. That's why blockchain is also called ""Distributed Ledger Technology"" or DLT.Here’s how it works:Someone or a computer will transactsThe transaction is transmitted throughout the network.A network of computers can confirm the transaction.When it is confirmed a transaction is added to a blockThe blocks are linked together to create a history. And that’s the beauty of it! The process may seem complicated, but it’s done in minutes with modern technology. And because technology is advancing rapidly, I expect things to move even more quickly than ever.A new transaction is added to the system. It is then relayed to a network of computers located around the world. The computers then solve equations to ensure the authenticity of the transaction.Once a transaction is confirmed, it is placed in a block after the confirmation. All of the blocks are chained together to create a permanent history of every transaction.How are Blockchains used?Even though blockchain is integral to cryptocurrency, it has other applications. For example, blockchain can be used for storing reliable data about transactions. Many people confuse blockchain with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum.Blockchain already being adopted by some big-name companies, such as Walmart, AIG, Siemens, Pfizer, and Unilever. For example, IBM's Food Trust uses blockchain to track food's journey before reaching its final destination.Although some of you may consider this practice excessive, food suppliers and manufacturers adhere to the policy of tracing their products because bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella have been found in packaged foods.

There are lots of questions floating around about how affiliate marketing works, what to do and what not to do when it comes to setting up a business. With so much uncertainty surrounding both personal and business aspects of affiliate marketing. In this post, we will answer the most frequently asked question about affiliate marketing1. What is affiliate marketing?&nbsp;Affiliate marketing is a way to make money by promoting the products and services of other people and companies. You don't need to create your product or service, just promote existing ones. That's why it's so easy to get started with affiliate marketing. You can even get started with no budget at all!2. What is an affiliate program?&nbsp;An affiliate program is a package of information you create for your product, which is then made available to potential publishers. The program will typically include details about the product and its retail value, commission levels, and promotional materials. Many affiliate programs are managed via an affiliate network like ShareASale, which acts as a platform to connect publishers and advertisers, but it is also possible to offer your program directly.3. What is an affiliate network and how do affiliate networks make money?&nbsp;&nbsp;Affiliate networks connect publishers to advertisers.&nbsp; Affiliate networks make money by charging fees to the merchants who advertise with them; these merchants are known as advertisers. The percentage of each sale that the advertiser pays is negotiated between the merchant and the affiliate network.4. What's the difference between affiliate marketing and dropshipping?&nbsp;Dropshipping is a method of selling that allows you to run an online store without having to stock products. You advertise the products as if you owned them, but when someone makes an order, you create a duplicate order with the distributor at a reduced price. The distributor takes care of the post and packaging on your behalf. As affiliate marketing is based on referrals and this type of drop shipping requires no investment in inventory when a customer buys through the affiliate link, no money exchanges hands.&nbsp;5. Can affiliate marketing and performance marketing be considered the same thing? &nbsp;Performance marketing is a method of marketing that pays for performance, like when a sale is made or an ad is clicked This can include methods like PPC (pay-per-click) or display advertising. Affiliate marketing is one form of performance marketing where commissions are paid out to affiliates on a performance basis when they click on their affiliate link and make a purchase or action.&nbsp;6. Is it possible to promote affiliate offers on mobile devices?&nbsp;Smartphones are essentially miniature computers, so publishers can display the same websites and offers that are available on a PC. But mobiles also offer specific tools not available on computers, and these can be used to good effect for publishers. Publishers can optimize their ads for mobile users by making them easy to access by this audience. Publishers can also make good use of text and instant messaging to promote their offers. As the mobile market is predicted to make up 80% of traffic in the future, publishers who do not promote on mobile devices are missing out on a big opportunity.7. Where do I find qualified publishers?&nbsp;The best way to find affiliate publishers is on reputable networks like ShareASale Cj(Commission Junction), Awin, and Impact radius. These networks have a strict application process and compliance checks, which means that all affiliates are trustworthy.8. What is an affiliate disclosure statement?&nbsp;An affiliate disclosure statement discloses to the reader that there may be affiliate links on a website, for which a commission may be paid to the publisher if visitors follow these links and make purchases.&nbsp;9. Does social media activity play a significant role in affiliate marketing?&nbsp;Publishers promote their programs through a variety of means, including blogs, websites, email marketing, and pay-per-click ads. Social media has a huge interactive audience, making this platform a good source of potential traffic.10. What is a super affiliate?&nbsp;A super affiliate is an affiliate partner who consistently drives a large majority of sales from any program they promote, compared to other affiliate partners involved in that program.&nbsp; Affiliates make a lot of money from affiliate marketing Pat Flynn earned more than $50000 in 2013 from affiliate marketing.11. How do we track publisher sales activity?&nbsp;Publishers can be identified by their publisher ID, which is used in tracking cookies to determine which publishers generate sales. The activity is then viewed within a network's dashboard.&nbsp;12. Could we set up an affiliate program in multiple countries?&nbsp;Because the Internet is so widespread, affiliate programs can be promoted in any country. Affiliate strategies that are set internationally need",2025-11-28 14:15:19.964136+00:00,https://techncruncher.blogspot.com/2022/06/most-frequently-asked-questions-about.html,techcrunch,technology & ai,0

In the face of multiple crises, disruptive technology and populism, making Britain orderly again is an impossible goalThis Labour government loves rules. Fiscal rules, stability rules, investment rules, immigration rules and rules restricting protests: this government’s first impulse, when faced with the fluidity and chaos of the modern world, is to put in boundaries and try to police them. Keir Starmer, a methodical person as well as a former director of public prosecutions, is so keen on orderliness that in 2022 his close colleague Lisa Nandy called him “Mr Rules”.There are things to be said for this approach. Many voters have been saying for at least a decade that they want politicians to exert more control over Britain’s erratic trajectory. Meanwhile the recent catastrophic administration of Boris Johnson, with its vast carelessness about Covid deaths, Brexit and immigration, still looms over our politics as a demonstration of what happens when governments have little interest in rules. As tech oligarchs, bond traders, international criminals, and digital and physical viruses increasingly prey on vulnerable people, it can be argued that a libertarian or fiscally loose government is a luxury most Britons can’t afford.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...",2025-11-28 06:00:57+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/28/keir-starmer-labour-mr-rules-britain,guardian_politics,technology & ai,0

First, that the average growth rate for the economy from 2026 to 2029 will be only 1.5%, rather than the 1.8% expected in March. Second, real-terms annual growth in disposable incomes will be tiny.

t3_1p7oc2b,"Elementary school students are helping Tucson reach its zero waste goal: “From Scraps to Soil” is a community partnership that will establish a circular economy driven by composting.. Snippet: Tucson students are learning how leftovers from their school lunches can help grow the foods making up their future meals through a new city-led initiative, “From Scraps to Soil.” The program is federally funded through the U.S. Department of Agriculture Composting and Food Waste Reduction grant. It supplies $360,000 over the course of two years to help 10 TUSD schools turn food waste into compost, which will then be returned to school and community gardens to help grow produce. The project is also in partnership with the local nonprofit Iskashitaa Refugee Network, which will serve as a resource for employment, volunteering and education. The nonprofit’s harvest program recovers up to 50 tons of local produce every year that would otherwise go to waste, according to Amelia Natoli, the acting director. “If you’ve ever wondered what our name means, ‘Iskashitaa’ means working cooperatively together. We’re grateful to be part of this project,” Natoli said. Lisa Rotello, a principal planner with the city’s environmental services, said the program will promote a circular economy, helping Tucson achieve its long term sustainability goals outlined in its Climate Action Plan. One of those goals is to divert 50% of Tucson’s waste by 2030, with the ultimate vision of achieving zero waste by 2050. Plans from the city’s 2023 Zero Waste Roadmap propose school programs and curricula that would enhance waste diversion efforts. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that food is the single highest contributor to everyday trash. Food waste also accounts for about 60% of landfill-to-atmosphere methane emissions, contributing to the breakdown of the ozone laye &#32; submitted by &#32; /u/Silent-Resort-3076 [link] &#32; [comments]",2025-11-27 00:32:33+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/comments/1p7oc2b/elementary_school_students_are_helping_tucson/,reddit_uplifting_news,climate & environment,0
