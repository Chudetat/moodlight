# Moodlight — What You Can Do With It

Everything Moodlight delivers — from proactive alerts to strategic analysis — is designed to give you an intelligence advantage. Here's how to get the most out of it.

---

## Part 1: What Moodlight Does For You (No Action Required)

These features run autonomously. You receive intelligence without logging in.

### Real-Time Alert Emails
When Moodlight's 21 detectors catch something significant — a brand crisis forming, a competitor gaining momentum, a geopolitical signal rippling into markets, or a breaking story spreading across sources — you get an email with the full AI investigation attached. Not a notification. A briefing.

Each alert includes: what happened, why it matters, historical context, and a recommended action with a confidence score.

### Twice-Daily Intelligence Briefs
Every morning and evening, you receive an executive intelligence brief covering:
- **Key Threats** — tagged as [NEW] or [ONGOING] with confidence levels
- **Watch List** — lower priority items that could escalate
- **Emerging Patterns** — signals that are accelerating or decelerating
- **Recommended Actions** — immediate, short-term, and monitor categories

### Weekly Strategic Digest
Every Monday morning, a deep strategic review lands in your inbox:
- Top patterns from the past week (accelerating, stable, or decelerating)
- VLDS trend analysis for your watched brands
- Competitive shifts — who's gaining, who's losing
- Forward-looking assessment for the week ahead

### Adaptive Learning
Every alert card in the dashboard has thumbs up/down buttons. Use them. Moodlight adjusts its detection sensitivity based on your feedback — raising thresholds on alerts you dismiss, lowering them on alerts you value. The more you use it, the sharper it gets.

## Part 2: The Dashboard

When you log in, here's what you're looking at and how to use each section.

### Cultural Pulse (Top of Page)
The global mood score (0-100) measures the *tone* of public discourse — not whether the news is good or bad, but whether people are talking with empathy or hostility. A score of 68 during a crisis means people are discussing it with nuance. A score of 32 during a product launch means the conversation is hostile.

**Use it for:** Reading the room. Before launching a campaign, check the cultural temperature.

### Intelligence Alerts
Every anomaly Moodlight has detected in the past 7 days, ranked by severity:
- **Red** = Critical (act now)
- **Yellow** = Warning (monitor closely)
- **Blue** = Informational
- **Purple** = Predictive (early warning — this hasn't happened yet, but the data says it will)
- **Chain Link** = Situation Report (multiple signals are connected — read the unified analysis)

Click any alert to expand the full AI investigation. Multi-step reasoning chains show you each phase: situation assessment, historical context, causal analysis, strategic implications, and confidence score.

**Use it for:** Catching things before your competitors do. Check daily or rely on the email alerts.

### Competitive War Room
For every brand on your watchlist, Moodlight automatically discovers competitors and tracks:
- **Share of Voice** — who owns the conversation
- **VLDS Comparison** — side-by-side brand health metrics
- **Competitor Profiles** — AI-generated summaries of each competitor's positioning
- **AI Positioning Insights** — on-demand strategic analysis

**Use it for:** Knowing where you stand relative to competitors in real time — without commissioning a report.

### Brand VLDS Dashboard
When you select a brand in the sidebar, you get a deep dive into its four health metrics:
- **Velocity** — Is conversation momentum increasing or slowing?
- **Longevity** — Is this a sustained narrative or a flash?
- **Density** — Is the space crowded or wide open?
- **Scarcity** — Where are the first-mover opportunities?

Plus: topic breakdown, emotion distribution, and empathy scoring specific to that brand.

**Use it for:** Brand health checks. Run this before a board meeting or quarterly review.

### Velocity x Longevity Map
A strategic quadrant showing where every topic sits:
- **Top right (high velocity + high longevity)** = Evergreen momentum — ride this wave
- **Top left (high velocity + low longevity)** = Trending spike — act fast or miss it
- **Bottom right (low velocity + high longevity)** = Established but cooling — the crowd has moved on
- **Bottom left** = Low signal

**Use it for:** Deciding where to invest attention. Topics in the top-right are your safest bets.

### Density and Scarcity
- **Density** shows saturated topics — crowded spaces where it's hard to break through
- **Scarcity** shows white space — underserved topics where you can own the conversation

**Use it for:** Content strategy. Don't pile into saturated topics. Find the white space and claim it.

### Mood vs. Market
Tracks the gap between social sentiment and market performance. When the two diverge, something is about to move.

**Use it for:** Leading indicator. Social mood often shifts before markets react.

## Part 3: Ask Moodlight

This is where the full power lives. Ask Moodlight is a conversational AI analyst with access to everything — live web intelligence, 7 days of scored dashboard data, 30 days of alert history, metric trends, and competitive intelligence. It applies 19 strategic frameworks automatically based on your question.

Here's what you can ask and what you'll get back.

### Brand Intelligence
Ask about any brand — whether it's on your watchlist or not.

**Try these:**
- *"How is Nike doing right now?"*
- *"What's the competitive landscape for Peloton?"*
- *"What threats does Caraway face?"*
- *"Who is winning the electric vehicle conversation?"*

**What you get:** A competitive intelligence brief framed for the brand's leadership team — media narrative, competitive threats, positioning gaps, customer sentiment, and actionable opportunities. Moodlight pulls live web articles, searches its dashboard signals, loads past alerts and metric trends for that brand, and checks competitive snapshots if the brand is on your watchlist.

### Event and Breaking News Intelligence
Ask about anything that just happened or is happening now.

**Try these:**
- *"What's happening with the tariff situation?"*
- *"Break down the cultural conversation around the Super Bowl"*
- *"What are the implications of today's Fed announcement?"*

**What you get:** Real-time synthesis from live web search combined with Moodlight's cultural signals. Event analysis, dominant themes, emotional patterns, and strategic implications.

### Trend and Topic Analysis
Explore what's moving in the cultural conversation.

**Try these:**
- *"What topics are trending right now?"*
- *"What are people most emotional about this week?"*
- *"Where is the white space — what topics are underserved?"*
- *"What's the mood around AI regulation?"*

**What you get:** Data-grounded analysis citing specific post counts, emotion distributions, velocity scores, and density metrics from the dashboard. No hallucinated numbers — every metric is verified from real data.

### On-Demand Intelligence Reports
Ask Moodlight to generate a comprehensive report on any subject.

**Try these:**
- *"Generate a report on Tesla"*
- *"Deep dive on AI trends for the last 30 days"*
- *"Full analysis on Nike for the past two weeks"*

**What you get:** A structured intelligence report covering: executive summary, signal analysis, alert history, VLDS assessment, competitive position (for brands), strategic outlook, and recommended actions. These are the same quality as the reports you can generate from the sidebar.

### Strategic Brief Generation
When you need to hand something to your creative team or agency.

**Try these:**
- *"Generate a strategic brief for Oatly targeting health-conscious millennials"*
- *"Give me a brief for a fintech app launching in the current economic climate"*
- *"Create a brief prompt based on the white space opportunities you see"*

**What you get:** A structured brief with Product/Service, Target Audience, Markets/Geography, Key Challenge, and Timeline — grounded in what the data actually shows, not generic marketing advice.

### Long-Form Strategic Content
Ask Moodlight to write strategic analysis, positioning documents, or thought leadership.

**Try these:**
- *"Write a positioning analysis for a DTC skincare brand entering the wellness space"*
- *"Draft a competitive response strategy for a brand losing share of voice to a new entrant"*
- *"What would a cultural trends report look like for Q1 based on what you're seeing?"*

**What you get:** Long-form strategic content that reads like it came from a senior strategist — grounded in real signals, specific about threats and opportunities, and free of generic consulting language. Ask Moodlight writes like a sharp advisor talking to a CEO, not a chatbot generating filler.

### Follow-Up Conversations
Ask Moodlight maintains context across your conversation. Build on what it tells you.

**Try these:**
- *"Go deeper on the second threat you mentioned"*
- *"How does that compare to what's happening in Europe?"*
- *"Now give me a brief based on that analysis"*
- *"What would you recommend if I only had budget for one campaign?"*

**What you get:** Continuity. Moodlight remembers what it told you and builds on it. Use this to drill into specifics, pressure-test recommendations, or pivot the analysis.
