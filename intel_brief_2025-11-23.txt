KEY THREATS:
1. **Ukraine Conflict Negotiations**: President Trump's proposal to negotiate an end to the Ukraine war is causing significant political tension. U.S. senators and allies are critical, and the situation requires careful diplomatic management to avoid undermining international alliances.
2. **Rising Antisemitism in Europe**: The Czech Jewish community reports a record number of antisemitic incidents in 2024, exacerbated by the ongoing Gaza conflict. This rise in hate crimes poses a threat to social stability and requires monitoring and potential intervention.
